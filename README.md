# Claude Git agent - WIP
Simple agent for managing git commits. This agent will validate any security concers, craft commit messages based on the work done and commit said changes to the projects remote repo. 

## Requirements
If you want autonomous commits, you need to set up ssh keys and allow the agent access to the repo.
